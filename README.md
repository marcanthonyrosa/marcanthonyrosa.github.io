# Introduction

This repository is where I store the files used for my public marcanthonyrosa.github.io website! I lean on github.io to host a simple "about me" web page with a few minor interactive elements.

My website includes:

* An overview [page](marcrosa.me/)
* An about me [page](marcrosa.me/about)
* A simple portfolio [page](marcrosa.me/portfolio)
* A link to my [Resume](marcrosa.me/resume.pdf)

And that's it!

Looking forward to adding more details here!
